### Hello there! 👋
#### My name is Jason. Allow me to briefly introduce myself:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on completing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) master's degree program
- 👨‍💼 I previously completed a Master of Business Administration (MBA) program
- 💻 I also have undergraduate degrees in Computer Information Systems and Liberal Arts & Sciences
- 💼 I have an extensive background in Information Technology, providing services in various industries
  - Steel Manufacturing, Education, Banking/Financial Services, Critical Infrastructure/Defense
- 💬 Ask me about AI, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing
  - You can also ask me about my dog, Booker! 🐕
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently learning to play the piano 🎹

#### ✔️ A few of my recent contributions:
- https://github.com/jerm914/Job-Site-Safety---AAI-540 - MLOps project, defining a business problem to improve job site safety and building an end-to-end ML system on AWS <img src='logos/Amazon_Web_Services_Logo.svg' alt='AWS Logo' style='width:25px; height:22px;' />, including CI/CD pipelines to provide automation to the overall process. We opt to use Amazon SageMaker Script Mode instead of choosing an available algorithm, which allows us to incorporate the customization needed to operationalize an Ultralytics YOLOv8 <img src='logos/64994922cf2a6385a4bf4489_UltralyticsYOLO_mark_blue.svg' alt='Ultralytics Logo' style='width:18px; height:18px;' /> model for object detection using the PyTorch framework and containers.
- https://github.com/jeraimondi/aai-cv-obj-detect-fashion - Computer vision (object detection) project, detecting fashion objects using multiple model architectures. My area of focus is on RetinaNet and development of a web application using Streamlit <img src='logos/streamlit-mark-color.png' alt='Streamlit Logo' style='width:23px; height:13px;' />.
- https://github.com/snagalingam/generative-chatbot - Natural Language Processing project, developing an advanced generative chatbot using a transformer-based model architecture. We use a GPT-2 model, fine-tuning for a specific dataset related to Ubuntu chat dialogue. I also work on development of a web application using Gradio <img src='logos/gradio-logo.0d4f62e9.png' alt='Gradio Logo' style='width:23px; height:23px;' /> and host it on Hugging Face &#x1F917;.
- https://github.com/jeraimondi/aai-nn-classification-composer - Neural Networks and Deep Learning project, with the task of classifying the Classical composer of a given piece. Musical scores are converted into Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) digital file format in order to programmatically extract different features. We use both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (with multiple inputs) model architectures to experiment and compare performance between each.

#### 🔜 Coming Soon!:
- Capstone Project
